#GPCO - GA

This genetic algorithm was design to be as general as possible, while still being simple
to use on the GPCO project.

The main class `GeneticAlgorithm` will be given the size of the desired population, and the
genes available for the genomes. Then, the function `create_population` will create the
starting genomes, with the ability to use a **custom** function to generate these first 
individuals.

Finally, the function `optimize`, receives a user given function to score the genomes,
and optimizes them using evolutionary techniques such as **crossover** and **mutation**.

If you feel like it, you can jump straight to the [code test](#test.py).
